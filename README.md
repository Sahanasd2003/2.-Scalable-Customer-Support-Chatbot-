Scalable-Customer-Support-Chatbot

This project is a simple chatbot web app built using Python, Flask, and various NLP libraries such as NLTK, SpaCy, and transformers. The chatbot uses the Huggingface transformers library with the microsoft/DialoGPT-medium model to generate responses to user inputs. It also uses NLTK and SpaCy for additional text processing.



Installation
Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
Download NLTK data:

python -c "import nltk; nltk.download('punkt')"
Usage
py app.py
How It Works
Flask Server: The Flask web server renders the HTML template and handles incoming POST requests to generate chatbot responses.

NLP Processing:

NLTK: Used for tokenizing the input message.
SpaCy: Used for named entity recognition (NER) and part-of-speech (POS) tagging.
Transformers: The chatbot uses the Huggingface transformers library with the microsoft/DialoGPT-medium model to generate responses to user inputs.

Examples
Here are some example messages you can try with the chatbot:

"Hello!"

"What is your name?"

"Can you tell me a joke?"

"I like cats."

"What's the meaning of life?"
